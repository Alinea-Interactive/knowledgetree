<p class="descriptiveText">{i18n}Instead of manually creating the group within
the document management system, the group can be found within an
authentication source (such as an LDAP directory) that has already been
configured.  This ensures that the group is correctly set up with limited
intervention from the administrator, and that the group's membership
will be maintained as it is in the authentication source.{/i18n}</p>
